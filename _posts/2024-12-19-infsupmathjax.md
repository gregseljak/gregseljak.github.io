When it comes to limits of sets, I've always had a hard time keeping $\overline{\lim}A_n$ and $\underline{\lim}A_n$ straight in my head.
On the other hand, the lim sup/inf of functions (or sequences) has an obvious interpretation. I would never mix up $\overline{lim}x_n$ and $\underline{lim}x_n$.
I knew that the two concepts shared notation because they were in some way analogous to each other, but I never really thought about the precise
correspondence between the two. It's more of a mnemonic than a really profound finding, but maybe others can use it too.
$$\text{Let }\{x_n\}\text{ be an infinite sequence in }\mathbb{R}$$
$$\text{Let }A_n=(-\infty,x_n]\$$
Now find the inf/sup limits of $A_n$ in terms of the inf/sup limits of $x_n$.
